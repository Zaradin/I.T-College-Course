This assignment is part of the computer programming course I'm doing
====================================================================

#### The algorithm that needs to be implemented is as follows

```
When this program is executed, it will first prompt the user what this program is used for.
**Data-Entry:**
Prompt the user to enter a four letter String, a three digit number and then some type of character symbol.
**Data validity:**
Check each piece of data entered to check if it's valid, if it's not prompt the user
**Data conversion:**
After the user entered the individual data it will convert each piece of data to a standalone String.
**Print individual converted data:**
Print each piece of data to the user.
**Concatenate data and save result in a predefined variable:**
Concatenate each piece of data to a unified String.
Print the concatenated string to the user.

```
